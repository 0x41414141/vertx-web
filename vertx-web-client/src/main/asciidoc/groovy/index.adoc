= Vert.x Web Client

Vert.x Web Client is an asynchronous HTTP / HTTP/2 client.

The Web Client makes easy to do HTTP request/response interactions with a web server, and provides advanced
features like:

* Json body encoding / decoding
* request/response pumping
* error handling

The web client does not deprecate the Vert.x Core `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]`, it is actually based on
it and therefore inherits its configuration and great features like pooling. The `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]`
should be used when fine grained control over the HTTP requests/response is necessary.

== Using the web client

To use Vert.x Web Client, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-web-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.4.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {
  compile 'io.vertx:vertx-web-client:3.4.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
----

== Re-cap on Vert.x core HTTP client

Vert.x Web Client uses the API from Vert.x core, so it's well worth getting familiar with the basic concepts of using
`link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` using Vert.x core, if you're not already.

== Creating a web client

You create an `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/webclient/WebClient.html[WebClient]` instance with default options as follows:

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.webclient.WebClient
def client = WebClient.create(vertx)

----

If you want to configure options for the client, you create it as follows:

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.webclient.WebClient
def options = [
  keepAlive:false
]
def client = WebClient.wrap(vertx.createHttpClient(options))

----

== Making requests

=== Simple requests with no request body

Often, youâ€™ll want to make HTTP requests with no request body. This is usually the case with HTTP GET, OPTIONS
and HEAD requests:

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.webclient.WebClient

def client = WebClient.create(vertx)

// Send a GET request
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").send({ ar ->
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    // Obtain response
    def response = ar.result()

    println("Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  } else {
    println("Something went wrong ${ar.cause().getMessage()}")
  }
})

// Send a HEAD request
client.head(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").send({ ar ->
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    // Obtain response
    def response = ar.result()

    println("Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  } else {
    println("Something went wrong ${ar.cause().getMessage()}")
  }
})

----

The `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/webclient/HttpRequest.html#send-io.vertx.core.Handler-[send]` method can be called multiple times
safely, making it very easy to configure http requests and reuse them:

[source,java]
----
def get = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri")
get.send({ ar ->
})

// Same request again
get.send({ ar ->
})

----

Further more, the `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/webclient/HttpRequest.html[HttpRequest]` instance is copied before any mutation, so it can
be mutated safely for further customization:

Todo : make example with params ?
