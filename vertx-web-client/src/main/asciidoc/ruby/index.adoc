= Vert.x Web Client

Vert.x Web Client is an asynchronous HTTP / HTTP/2 client.

The Web Client makes easy to do HTTP request/response interactions with a web server, and provides advanced
features like:

* Json body encoding / decoding
* request/response pumping
* error handling

The web client does not deprecate the Vert.x Core `link:../../yardoc/Vertx/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]`, it is actually based on
it and therefore inherits its configuration and great features like pooling. The `link:../../yardoc/Vertx/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]`
should be used when fine grained control over the HTTP requests/response is necessary.

== Using the web client

To use Vert.x Web Client, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-web-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.4.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {
  compile 'io.vertx:vertx-web-client:3.4.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
----

== Re-cap on Vert.x core HTTP client

Vert.x Web Client uses the API from Vert.x core, so it's well worth getting familiar with the basic concepts of using
`link:../../yardoc/Vertx/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` using Vert.x core, if you're not already.

== Creating a web client

You create an `link:../../yardoc/VertxWebClient/WebClient.html[WebClient]` instance with default options as follows:

[source,java]
----
require 'vertx-web-client/web_client'
client = VertxWebClient::WebClient.create(vertx)

----

If you want to configure options for the client, you create it as follows:

[source,java]
----
require 'vertx-web-client/web_client'
options = {
  'keepAlive' => false
}
client = VertxWebClient::WebClient.wrap(vertx.create_http_client(options))

----

== Making requests

=== Simple requests with no request body

Often, youâ€™ll want to make HTTP requests with no request body. This is usually the case with HTTP GET, OPTIONS
and HEAD requests:

[source,java]
----
require 'vertx-web-client/web_client'

client = VertxWebClient::WebClient.create(vertx)

# Send a GET request
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").send() { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    # Obtain response
    response = ar

    puts "Received response with status code#{response.status_code()}"
  else
    puts "Something went wrong #{ar_err.get_message()}"
  end
}

# Send a HEAD request
client.head(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").send() { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    # Obtain response
    response = ar

    puts "Received response with status code#{response.status_code()}"
  else
    puts "Something went wrong #{ar_err.get_message()}"
  end
}

----

You can add query parameters to the request URI in a fluent fashion:

[source,java]
----

Any request URI parameter will pre-populate the request:

[source,java]
----
request = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri?param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value")

# Add param3
request.add_query_param("param3", "param3_value")

# Overwrite param2
request.set_query_param("param2", "another_param2_value")

=== Requests with a body

todo : show how to send a buffer or stream buffers

==== Sending json

==== Sending forms

=== Reusing requests

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxWebClient/HttpRequest.html#send-instance_method[send]` method can be called multiple times
safely, making it very easy to configure http requests and reuse them:

=== Decoding responses

todo

=== RxJava API

The RxJava `HttpRequest` provides an augmented versions of the original API,
the `rxSend()` method returns a `Single<HttpResponse<Buffer>>`:

* the HTTP request is sent upon subscription of the `Single`
* the `Single` can be subscribed many times

[source,java]

The obtained `Single` can be composed and chained naturally with the RxJava API:
