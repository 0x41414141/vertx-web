= Vert.x Web Client

Vert.x Web Client is an asynchronous HTTP / HTTP/2 client.

The Web Client makes easy to do HTTP request/response interactions with a web server, and provides advanced
features like:

* Json body encoding / decoding
* request/response pumping
* error handling

The web client does not deprecate the Vert.x Core `link:../../jsdoc/module-vertx-js_http_client-HttpClient.html[HttpClient]`, it is actually based on
it and therefore inherits its configuration and great features like pooling. The `link:../../jsdoc/module-vertx-js_http_client-HttpClient.html[HttpClient]`
should be used when fine grained control over the HTTP requests/response is necessary.

== Using the web client

To use Vert.x Web Client, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-web-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.4.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {
  compile 'io.vertx:vertx-web-client:3.4.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
----

== Re-cap on Vert.x core HTTP client

Vert.x Web Client uses the API from Vert.x core, so it's well worth getting familiar with the basic concepts of using
`link:../../jsdoc/module-vertx-js_http_client-HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` using Vert.x core, if you're not already.

== Creating a web client

You create an `link:../../jsdoc/module-vertx-web-client-js_web_client-WebClient.html[WebClient]` instance with default options as follows:

[source,java]
----
var WebClient = require("vertx-web-client-js/web_client");
var client = WebClient.create(vertx);

----

If you want to configure options for the client, you create it as follows:

[source,java]
----
var WebClient = require("vertx-web-client-js/web_client");
var options = {
  "keepAlive" : false
};
var client = WebClient.wrap(vertx.createHttpClient(options));

----

== Making requests

=== Simple requests with no request body

Often, youâ€™ll want to make HTTP requests with no request body. This is usually the case with HTTP GET, OPTIONS
and HEAD requests:

[source,java]
----
var WebClient = require("vertx-web-client-js/web_client");

var client = WebClient.create(vertx);

// Send a GET request
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").send(function (ar, ar_err) {
  if (ar_err == null) {
    // Obtain response
    var response = ar;

    console.log("Received response with status code" + response.statusCode());
  } else {
    console.log("Something went wrong " + ar_err.getMessage());
  }
});

// Send a HEAD request
client.head(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").send(function (ar, ar_err) {
  if (ar_err == null) {
    // Obtain response
    var response = ar;

    console.log("Received response with status code" + response.statusCode());
  } else {
    console.log("Something went wrong " + ar_err.getMessage());
  }
});

----

The `link:../../jsdoc/module-vertx-web-client-js_http_request-HttpRequest.html#send[send]` method can be called multiple times
safely, making it very easy to configure http requests and reuse them:

[source,java]
----
var get = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri");
get.send(function (ar, ar_err) {
});

// Same request again
get.send(function (ar, ar_err) {
});

----

Further more, the `link:../../jsdoc/module-vertx-web-client-js_http_request-HttpRequest.html[HttpRequest]` instance is copied before any mutation, so it can
be mutated safely for further customization:

Todo : make example with params ?
