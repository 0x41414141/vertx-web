= Apex
:toc: left

Apex is a set of building blocks for building web applications with Vert.x.

Think of it as a Swiss Army Knife for building
modern, scalable, web apps.

Vert.x core provides a fairly low level set of functionality for handling HTTP, and for some applications
that will be sufficient.

Vert.x Apex builds on Vert.x core to provide a richer set of functionality for building real web applications, more
easily.

It's the successor to http://pmlopes.github.io/yoke/[Yoke] in Vert.x 2.x, and takes inspiration from projects such
as http://expressjs.com/[Express] in the Node.js world and http://www.sinatrarb.com/[Sinatra] in the Ruby world.

Apex is designed to be powerful, un-opionated and fully embeddable. You just use the parts you want and nothing more.

Apex is not a container.

You can use Apex to create classic server-side web applications, RESTful web applications, 'real-time' (server push)
web applications, or any other kind of web application you can think of. Apex doesn't care.

It's up to you to chose the type of app you prefer, not Apex.

Apex is a great fit for writing *RESTful HTTP micro-services*, but we don't *force* you to write apps like that.

Some of the key features of Apex include:

* Routing (based on method, path, etc)
* Regex pattern matching for paths
* Extraction of parameters from paths
* Content negotiation
* Request body handling
* Body size limits
* Cookie parsing and handling
* Multipart forms
* Multipart file uploads
* Sub routers

Apex add-ons include:

* Session support - both local (for sticky sessions) and clustered (for non sticky)
* CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) support
* Error page template
* Basic Authentication
* Redirect based authentication
* User/role/permission authorisation
* Favicon handling
* Template support for server side rendering. Supports: Handlebars, Jade, MVEL and Thymeleaf out of the box
* Response time handler
* Static file serving, including caching logic and directory listing.
* Request timeout support

Most features in Apex are implemented as handlers so you can always write your own. We envisage many more being written
over time.

We'll discuss all these features in this manual.

== Re-cap on Vert.x core HTTP servers

Apex uses and exposes API from Vert.x core, so it's well worth getting familiar with the basic concepts of writing
HTTP servers using Vert.x core, if you're not already.

The Vert.x core HTTP documentation goes into a lot of detail on this.

Here's a hello world web server written using Vert.x core. At this point there is no Apex involved:

[source,java]
----
var server = vertx.createHttpServer();
server.requestHandler(function (request) {
  var response = request.response();
  response.putHeader("content-type", "text/plain");
  response.end("Hello World!");
});
server.listen(8080);

----

We create an HTTP server instance, and we set a request handler on it. The request handler will be called whenever
a request arrives on the server.

When that happens we are just going to set the content type to `text/plain`, and write `Hello World!` and end the
response.

We then tell the server to listen at port `8080` (default host is `localhost`).

You can run this, and point your browser at `http://localhost:8080` to verify that it works as expected.

== Basic Apex concepts

Here's the 10000 foot view:

A link:jsdoc/router-Router.html[`Router`] is one of the core concepts of Apex.

A router is an object which maintains zero or more link:jsdoc/route-Route.html[`Route`]s.

A router handles an HTTP request and finds the first matching route for that request, and passes the request to that route.

The route can have a *handler* associated with it, which then receives the request.

You then *do something* with the request, and then, either end it or pass it to the next matching handler.

Here's the simplest router example:

[source,java]
----
todo
----

It's basically does the same thing as the Vert.x Core HTTP server hello world example from the previous section,
but this time using Apex.

We create an HTTP server as before, then we create a router.

Once we've done that we create a simple route with no matching criteria so it will match *all* requests that arrive on the server.

We then specify a handler for that route. That handler will be called for all requests that arrive on the server.

The object that gets passed into the handler is a link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html[`RoutingContext`] - this contains
the standard Vert.x link:jsdoc/htt_serve_request-HttpServerRequest.html[`HttpServerRequest`] and link:jsdoc/htt_serve_response-HttpServerResponse.html[`HttpServerResponse`]
but also various other useful stuff that makes working with Apex simpler.

For every request that is routed there is a unique routing context instance, and the same instance is passed to
all handlers for that request.

Once we've set up the handler, we set the request handler of the HTTP server to pass all incoming requests
to link:jsdoc/router-Router.html#accept[`accept`].

So, that's the basics. Now we'll look at things in more detail:

== Handling requests and calling the next handler

When a route matches the handler for the route will be called, passing in an instance of link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html[`RoutingContext`].

If you don't end the request in your handler, you can call link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html#next[`next`] then the router
will call the next matching route handler (if any).

You don't have to call link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html#next[`next`] before the handler has finished executing.
You can do this some time later, if you want:

[source,java]
----
var route1 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route1\n");
  routingContext.vertx().setTimer(5000, function (tid) {
    routingContext.next()});
});
var route2 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route2\n");
  routingContext.vertx().setTimer(5000, function (tid) {
    routingContext.next()});
});
var route3 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route3");
  routingContext.response().end();
});
route2.order(-1);

----

In the above example `route1` is written to the response, then 5 seconds later `route2` is written to the response,
then 5 seconds later `route3` is written to the response and the response is ended.

Note, all this happens without any thread blocking.

== Routing by path

A route can be set-up to match the path from the request URI.

In this case it will match any request which has a path that *starts with* the specified path.

In the following example the handler will be called for all requests with a URI path that starts with
`/some/path/`.

For example `/some/path/foo.html` and `/some/path/otherdir/blah.css` would both match.

[source,java]
----
var route = router.route().path("/some/path/");
route.handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

Alternatively the path can be specified when creating the route:

[source,java]
----
var route = router.route("/some/path/");
route.handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

== Capturing path parameters

It's possible to match paths using placeholders for parameters which are then available in the request
link:jsdoc/htt_serve_request-HttpServerRequest.html#params[`params`].

Here's an example

[source,java]
----
todo
----

In the above example, if a POST request is made to path: `/catalogue/products/tools/drill123/` then the route will match
and `productType` will receive the value `tools` and productID will receive the value `drill123`.

== Routing with regular expressions

Regular expressions can also be used to match URI paths in routes.

As in straight path matching the regex is not an *exact match* for the path, but matches the start of the path.

[source,java]
----
var route = router.route().pathRegex(".*foo");
route.handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

Alternatively the regex can be specified when creating the route:

[source,java]
----
var route = router.routeWithRegex(".*foo");
route.handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

== Capturing path parameters with regular expressions

You can also capture path parameters when using regular expressions, here's an example:

[source,java]
----
var route = router.routeWithRegex(".*foo");
route.pathRegex("\\/([^\\/]+)\\/([^\\/]+)").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var productType = routingContext.request().params().get("param0");
  var productID = routingContext.request().params().get("param1");
});

----

In the above example, if a request is made to path: `/tools/drill123/` then the route will match
and `productType` will receive the value `tools` and productID will receive the value `drill123`.

Captures are denoted in regular expressions with capture groups (i.e. surrounding the capture with round brackets)

== Routing by HTTP method

By default a route will match all HTTP methods.

If you want a route to only match for a specific HTTP method you can use link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#method[`method`]

[source,java]
----
todo
----

Or you can specify this with a path when creating the route:

[source,java]
----
todo
----

If you want to route for a specific HTTP method you can also use the methods such as link:jsdoc/router-Router.html#get[`get`],
link:jsdoc/router-Router.html#post[`post`] and link:jsdoc/router-Router.html#put[`put`] named after the HTTP
method name. For example:

[source,java]
----
router.get().handler(function (routingContext) {
});
router.get("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
});
router.getWithRegex(".*foo").handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

If you want to specify a route will match for more than HTTP method you can call link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#method[`method`]
multiple times:

[source,java]
----
todo
----



== Route order

By default routes are matched in the order they are added to the router.

When a request arrives the router will step through each route and check if it matches, if it matches then
the handler for that route will be called.

If the handler subsequently calls link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html#next[`next`] the handler for the next
matching route (if any) will be called. And so on.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

[source,java]
----
var route1 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route1\n");
  routingContext.next();
});
var route2 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route2\n");
  routingContext.next();
});
var route3 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route3");
  routingContext.response().end();
});

----

In the above example the response will contain:

----
route1
route2
route3
----

As the routes have been called in that order for any request that starts with `/some/path`.

If you want to override the default ordering for routes, you can do so using link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#order[`order`],
specifying an integer value.

Default routes are assigned an implicit order corresponding to the order in which they were added to the router, with
the first route numbered `0`, the second route numbered `1`, and so on.

By specifying an order for the route you can override the default ordering. Order can also be negative, e.g. if you
want to ensure a route is evaluated before route number `0`.

Let's change the ordering of route2 so it runs before route1:

[source,java]
----
var route1 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route1\n");
  routingContext.next();
});
var route2 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route2\n");
  routingContext.next();
});
var route3 = router.route("/some/path/").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.write("route3");
  routingContext.response().end();
});
route2.order(-1);

----

then the response will now contain:

----
route2
route1
route3
----

If two matching routes have the same value of order, then they will be called in the order they were added.

You can also specify a route is handled last, with link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#last[`last`]

== Routing based on MIME type of request

You can specify that a route will match against matching request MIME types using link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#consumes[`consumes`].

In this case, the request will contain a `content-type` header specifying the MIME type of the request body.

This will be matched against the value specified in link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#consumes[`consumes`].

Basically, `consumes` is describing which MIME types the route will consume.

Matching can be done on exact MIME type matches:

[source,java]
----
router.route().consumes("text/html").handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

Multiple exact matches can also be specified:

[source,java]
----
router.route().consumes("text/html").consumes("text/plain").handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

Matching on wildcards for the sub-type is supported:

[source,java]
----
router.route().consumes("text/*").handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

And you can also match on the top level type

[source,java]
----
router.route().consumes("*/json").handler(function (routingContext) {
});

----

If you don't specify a `/` in the consumers, it will assume you meant the sub-type.

== Routing based on MIME types acceptable by the client

The HTTP `accept` header is used to signify which MIME types of the response are acceptable to the client.

An `accept` header can have multiple MIME types separated by `,`. MIME types can also have a `q` value appended to them
which signifies a weighting to apply if more than one response MIME type is available matching the accept header. The
q value is a number between 0 and 1.0. If omitted it defaults to 1.0.

For example, the following `accept` header signifies the client will accept a MIME type of only `text/plain`:

 Accept: text/plain

 With the following the client will accept `text/plain` or `text/html` with no preference.

 Accept: text/plain, text/html

 With the following the client will accept `text/plain` or `text/html` but prefers `text/html` as it has a higher `q` value
 (the default value is q=1.0)

 Accept: text/plain; q=0.9, text/html

 If the server can provide both text/plain and text/html it should provide the text/html in this case.

By using link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#produces[`produces`] you define which MIME type(s) the route produces, e.g. the
following handler produces a response with MIME type `application/json`.

[source,java]
----
router.route().produces("application/json").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  response.putHeader("content-type", "application/json");
  response.write(someJSON).end();
});

----

In this case the route will match with any request with an `accept` header that matches `application/json`.

Here are some examples of `accept` headers that will match:

 Accept: application/json
 Accept: application/*
 Accept: *json
 Accept: application/json, text/html
 Accept: application/json;q=0.7, text/html;q=0.8, text/plain

 You can also mark your route as producing more than one MIME type. If this is the case, then you use
 link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html#getAcceptableContentType[`getAcceptableContentType`] to find out the actual MIME type that
 was accepted.

[source,java]
----
router.route().produces("application/json").produces("text/html").handler(function (routingContext) {
  var response = routingContext.response();
  var acceptableContentType = routingContext.getAcceptableContentType();
  response.putHeader("content-type", acceptableContentType);
  response.write(whatever).end();
});

----

In the above example, if I sent a request with the following `accept` header:

 Accept: application/json; q=0.7, text/html

Then the route would match and `acceptableContentType` would contain `text/html` as both are
acceptable but that has a higher `q` value.

== Combining routing criteria

You can combine all the above routing criteria in many different ways, for example:

[source,java]
----
todo
----

== Enabling and disabling routes

You can disable a route with link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#disable[`disable`].

A disabled route will be ignored when matching.

You can re-enable a disabled route with link:jsdoc/route-Route.html#enable[`enable`]

== Context data

You can use the context data in the link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html[`RoutingContext`] to maintain any data that you
want to share between handlers for the lifetime of the request.

Here's an example where one handler sets some data in the context data a subsequent handler retrieves it:

You can use the link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html#put[`put`] to put any object, and
link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html#get[`get`] to retrieve any object from the context data.

A request sent to path `/some/path` will match both routes.

[source,java]
----
todo
----

Alternatively you can access the entire context data map with link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html#contextData[`contextData`].

== Sub-routers

Sometimes if you have a lot of handlers it can make sense to split them up into multiple routers. This is also useful
if you want to reuse a set of handlers in a different application, rooted at a different path root.

To do this you can mount a router at a _mount point_ in another router. The router that is mounted is called a
_sub-router_. Sub routers can mount other sub routers so you can have several levels of sub-routers if you like.

Let's look at a simple example of a sub-router mounted with another router.

The sub-router will maintain the set of handlers that corresponds to a simple fictional REST API. We will mount that on another
router. The full implementation of the REST API is not shown.

Here's the sub-router:

[source,java]
----
var Router = require("vertx-apex-core-js/router");
var restAPI = Router.router(vertx);
restAPI.get("/products/:productID").handler(function (rc) {
  rc.response().write(productJSON);
});
restAPI.put("/products/:productID").handler(function (rc) {
  rc.response().end();
});
restAPI.delete("/products/:productID").handler(function (rc) {
  rc.response().end();
});

----

If this router was used as a top level router, then GET/PUT/DELETE requests to urls like `/products/product1234`
would invoke the  API.

However, let's say we already have a web-site as described by another router:

[source,java]
----
var Router = require("vertx-apex-core-js/router");
var mainRouter = Router.router(vertx);
mainRouter.route("/static").handler(myStaticHandler);
mainRouter.route(".*\\.templ").handler(myTemplateHandler);

----

We can now mount the sub router on the main router, against a mount point, in this case `/productsAPI`

[source,java]
----
mainRouter.mountSubRouter("/productsAPI", restAPI);

----

This means the REST API is not accessible via paths like: `/productsAPI/products/product1234`

== Default 404 Handling

If no routes match for any particular request, Apex will signal a 404 error. This can then be handled by your
own error handler, or perhaps the augmented error handler that we supply to use, or if no error handler is provided
Apex will send back a basic 404 (Not Found) response.

== Error handling

As well as setting handlers to handle requests you can also set handlers to handle errors in Vert.x.

Error handlers can be used with the exact same route matching criteria that you can use with normal handlers.

For example you can provide an error handler that will only handle errors on certain paths, or for certain HTTP methods.

This allows you to set different error handlers for different parts of your web application.

Here's an example error handler that will only be called for errors that occur when routing to GET requests
to paths that start with `\somepath\`:

[source,java]
----
mainRouter.mountSubRouter("/productsAPI", restAPI);

----

Error routing will occur if a handler throws an exception, or if a handler calls
link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html#fail[`fail`] specifying an HTTP status code to deliberately signal a failure.

If an exception is caught from a handler this will result in a failure with status code `500` being signalled.

When handling the failure, the failure handler is passed an instance of link:jsdoc/failur_routin_context-FailureRoutingContext.html[`FailureRoutingContext`]
which is like link:jsdoc/routin_context-RoutingContext.html[`RoutingContext`] but which also allows the failure or failure code
to be retrieved so the failure handler can use that to generate a failure response.

[source,java]
----
var route = router.get("/somepath/");
route.failureHandler(function (frc) {
});

----


== Apex add-ons

Whereas Apex core contains basic routing functionality, Apex also provides a set of useful "add-ons" that you can
use to build real web applications more easily.
